* Akio Imai and Etsuko Nishimura and Stratos Papadimitriou (2001): The dynamic berth allocation problem for a container port
:PROPERTIES:
:Custom_id: Imai2001
:END:
- Lagrangian simplification to the BAP problem
- static BAP: given a collection of ships, finds a set of assignments to minimize the sum of the time they spend waiting for berths and handling cargo, has already been proposed
- DBAP: similar to the SBAP but with the difference that ships arrive while work is in progress.
- Make a good point to bring out all the assumptions they make
- Little proof of optimality for consecutive vessels
- static (at berth now), dynamic (at berth later)
- makes an attempt to minimize idle time at each berth
- Interesting idea to introduce at a high level what everything is in a section then derive it in another
