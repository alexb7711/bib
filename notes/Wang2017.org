* Wang, Xiumin and Yuen, Chau and Hassan, Naveed Ul and An, Ning and Wu, Weiwei (2017): Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement for Urban Public Bus Systems
:PROPERTIES:
:Custom_id: Wang2017a
:END:
- Brings up the fact that detours are not considered
- Minimizes the charging stations (does not really apply to PAP)
* Sebastiani, Mariana Teixeira and Lüders, Ricardo and Fonseca, Keiko Verônica Ono (2016): Evaluating Electric Bus Operation for a Real-World BRT Public Transportation Using Simulation Optimization
:PROPERTIES:
:Custom_id: Sebastiani2016
:END:
- Minimizes over number of changing stations and the average extra time stopped in the station to recharge
- Referenches to a paper ([10]) that uses simulation to estimate energy demand based on distances traveled by vehicles that follow a prbabilistic mobility model between urban areas
- Introduces a discrete event simulation computes variables of interest, including energy consumption for each bus in a round trip
- Has an interesting model to more accurately calculate power loss
- Has an easy way to make battery charge model more accurate
