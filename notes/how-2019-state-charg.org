* Notes
** INTRODUCTION
- The information of this review will be valuable to the academic researcher and automotive engineers towards the
  selection of appropriate SOC estimation method which is significant for the enhancement of BMS for future EV
  applications.

** OVERVIEW OF MODEL-BASED AND DATA-DRIVEN METHOD

*** Model Approach (white box)
- There exist two established decision-making paradigms to evaluate SOC; model-based and data-driven methods.
- This approach often involves the practitioner to have a deep understanding of the system or process in order to
  construct the robust rules that can model the behavior of the system accurately

*** Data Approach (black box)
- On the other hand, the data-driven based SOC estimation are relatively new approaches enabled by the advent of big
  quantity of data and powerful computers.
- The data-driven methods (also known as black-box models) are built upon empirical observations with minimal or no
  knowledge of the background processes

*** SOC ESTIMATION METHODS
- Based on recent published articles on SOC estimation, this review divides the SOC estimation methods into five groups
  namely; look-up table method, coulomb counting method, model-based estimation methods, data-driven estimation methods,
  and hybrid method, as shown in Fig. 5.

**** LOOK-UP TABLE
- Not relevant
- The look-up table method exploits the direct mapping relationship between SOC and the external characteristics
  parameters such as the open-circuit voltage (OCV), impedance, etc.
- The alternating current (AC) impedance methods is another technique under the look-up table category.

**** COULOMB COUNTING METHOD
Not relevant

**** MODEL-BASED SOC ESTIMATION METHODS
- EM Model
        - The model-based SOC estimation methods involve modeling of the electrical, chemical or a combination of both
          properties pertaining to a specific battery.
        - The EM model relies on partial differential equations (PDE) to describe battery dynamics such as lithium diffusion and
          potential gradients.
        - EM method can be very accurate, nonetheless PDE computations can be expensive for real-time SOC estimation
          [62].
- ECM Model
        - The ECM model based SOC evaluation requires the derivation of the circuit models consisting of various circuit
          elements arranged in series or parallel combination such that it replicates the dynamics of the battery.
        - The various ECM models have been proposed including the Rint model, the RC model, and the Thevenin model [24].
        - ECM is computationally inexpensive and has been used by researchers to estimate SOC in conjunction with
          adaptive filter algorithms such as the Kalman filter. [67].
- Observer Model
        - A work in [91] proposes a novel observer-based SOC estimation method for LIB, as depicted in Fig. 13.
