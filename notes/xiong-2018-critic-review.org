** INTRODUCTION

- The SoC of a battery is denied as the percentage of the remaining capacity in its maximum available capacity
- Early from the year of 1960s, the academics, researchers, scientists have per formed an extensive research to carry out the battery SoC estimation [14], [15].
- Thus, this paper hopes to all up the gap by exploring different existing methodologies and addressing the key issues and challenges for the SoC estimation of battery pack

** SoC ESTIMATION METHODS

*** LOOKING-UP TABLE BASED METHODS
- Given an open-circuit voltage, get a SOC from a table.

*** AMPERE-HOUR INTEGRAL METHOD
- When the maximum available capacity of a battery is known and its current can be measured precisely, the ampere-hour integral method can permit the accurate calculation of the variation of the SoC. If we know the initial SoC, we can obtain the accurate SoC.

z_k = z_0 âˆ’ \frac{\int_{t_0}^{t_k} \eta I_L t_0(t)dt}{Q}

where 

- $z$: SOC
- $z_0$: Initial SOC
- $z_k$: SOC at step $k$
- $t_k = t_0 + k\cdot \Delta t$
- $\Delta t$: sample interval
- $\eta$: coulomb efficiency
- $I_L(t)$: load current of batter
- $Q$: maximum capacity

*** MODEL-BASED ESTIMATION METHODS
- The most commonly used models can be roughly summarized as three types: electrochemical model (EM), equivalent circuit model (ECM) and electrochemical impedance model (EIM).
